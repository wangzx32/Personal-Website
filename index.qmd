  <summary style="color: black;"> Multivariate Analysis of Pizza Dataset </summary>

  - **Date**: January 2024 - March 2024
- **Institute**: UCLA
- **Paper**: [GoogleDoc](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P6JBxAuGrf2Y2OXIS0HUPdRkuJ8DpGZV/view?usp=sharing)
- **Abstract**: 

This study delves into the complex nutritional attributes of various pizza samples by analyzing data from 'Pizza.csv'. Through multivariate analysis techniques including Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Factor Analysis (FA), the research investigates the interrelationships between moisture, protein, fat, ash, sodium, carbohydrates, and calorie content per 100 grams of pizza. A comprehensive dataset comprising 300 samples and spanning nine variables enables a detailed nutritional profile assessment across different pizza brands.

The PCA results highlight the dominant variables influencing pizza nutrition, with carbohydrates, moisture, and fat exhibiting substantial variance. PCA reveals that the first two principal components collectively explain 92.32% of the total sample variance, suggesting strong data representation. PC1 primarily represents nutrient density, while PC2 reflects caloric hydration. FA further uncovers underlying factors explaining correlations among nutritional variables, revealing distinct dimensions of nutritional composition, such as overall composition, moisture distribution, and nutrient contrasts.

Applying varimax rotation to the factor solution enhances the clarity and interpretability of nutritional patterns. Despite a slight decrease in explained variance post-rotation, the redistributed variance enhances factor interpretability. The Maximum Likelihood Estimates (MLE) approach corroborates PCA findings, underscoring the significance of certain nutritional dimensions common across pizzas.

Overall, this study provides valuable insights for consumers, industry professionals, and policymakers regarding pizza nutrition. While acknowledging study limitations, such as potential dataset biases, future research avenues could explore additional factors influencing nutritional composition and integrate qualitative data for enhanced understanding. By leveraging multivariate statistical techniques, this research contributes to a nuanced understanding of pizza nutrition and lays a foundation for further investigation.
